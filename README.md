## 📈 Visualizations

To aid interpretation, I’ve created charts for several financial ratios including:
- **Gross Profit Margin**
- **Net Profit Margin**
- **Return on Equity (ROE)**
- **Debt-to-Equity Ratio**
- **Inventory Turnover**

These visualizations highlight the company’s performance trajectory and help identify strengths, weaknesses, and patterns.
